# ZooplanktonMeanSizeTotalStock
### Brief intro to the indicator

The HELCOM core indicator Zooplankton mean size and total stock (MSTS) is used to assess the status of pelagic habitat in the HELCOM Holistic Assessment of the Baltic Sea. The indicator report with information on indicator concept and results can be found on the HELCOM website, [here](https://helcom.fi/baltic-sea-trends/indicators/).

___

### Indicator data

The indicator use data collected as part of the [HELCOM COMBINE monitoring program](https://helcom.fi/action-areas/monitoring-and-assessment/monitoring-guidelines/combine-manual/). Data are reported to the COMBINE database maintained by [ICES](https://data.ices.dk/). The indicator calculation script here use data extracts from the COMBINE database, as well as it allows to use aggregated data (yearly means) as input.
